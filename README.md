## üåü Features

- **Container-Based Proxy Assignment**: Assign different proxies to different Firefox containers
- **Multiple Proxy Types**: Support for HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxies
- **Proxy Labels**: Add custom labels/comments to identify your proxies (e.g., "Seattle Server", "Work VPN")
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatic dark theme based on system preferences
- **Export/Import**: Backup and restore your proxy configurations
- **Connection Testing**: Test proxy connections before saving
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with responsive design

## üì¶ Installation

### From Release (Recommended)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:addons`
3. Click the gear icon and select "Install Add-on From File"
4. Select the downloaded `.zip` file

### Manual Installation (Development)
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox" ‚Üí "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Navigate to the `container-proxy-modern` folder and select `manifest.json`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set up Firefox Containers
- Go to Firefox Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Tabs
- Enable "Multi-Account Containers"
- Create containers for different purposes (Work, Personal, etc.)

### 2. Configure Proxies
- Click the Container Proxy extension icon
- Click "Add Proxy" for any container
- Fill in your proxy details:
  - **Type**: HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5
  - **Host**: Your proxy server IP/hostname
  - **Port**: Proxy server port
  - **Label**: Optional description (e.g., "Seattle Server")
  - **Credentials**: Username/password if required

### 3. Browse Securely
- Open tabs in different containers
- Each container will automatically use its assigned proxy
- Default container remains unproxied

## üîß Supported Proxy Types

### HTTP Proxy
- Standard HTTP proxy
- Traffic to proxy is unencrypted
- Good for basic routing

### HTTPS Proxy
- Encrypted connection to proxy
- More secure than HTTP
- Recommended for sensitive browsing

### SOCKS5 Proxy (Recommended)
- Most secure proxy type
- Supports DNS routing through proxy
- Best choice for privacy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### ‚úÖ Security Features
- **DNS Protection**: SOCKS5 proxies route DNS through the proxy
- **Credential Security**: Credentials only sent when explicitly provided
- **Container Isolation**: Each container uses its own proxy independently
- **No Data Logging**: Extension doesn't log or store browsing data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations
- **HTTP Proxies**: Traffic to proxy is unencrypted (use HTTPS/SOCKS5 when possible)
- **WebRTC Leaks**: Disable WebRTC in Firefox to prevent IP leaks
- **Default Container**: Default Firefox container doesn't use proxy
- **Credentials Storage**: Stored locally in Firefox (encrypted by Firefox)

**Recommendation**: Use SOCKS5 proxies with services like Gluetun for best security.

## üê≥ Gluetun Setup Example

If you're using Gluetun containers for VPN routing:

```
Type: HTTP
Host: 172.17.0.2 (your Gluetun container IP)
Port: 8888
Username: (leave empty)
Password: (leave empty)
Label: Gluetun VPN
```

## üìã Permissions Explained

This extension requires the following permissions:

- **`webRequest`**: To intercept web requests for proxy routing
- **`webRequestBlocking`**: To modify requests before they're sent
- **`proxy`**: To configure proxy settings
- **`contextualIdentities`**: To work with Firefox containers
- **`storage`**: To save proxy configurations
- **`<all_urls>`**: To route traffic from all websites through proxies

These permissions are necessary for any proxy extension to function properly.
